          <p>Children’s Charities of Fort Worth was formed in 1989 as a
          501(c)(3) charitable organization. The charity is supported through
          directors and volunteers of the Fort Worth Margarita Society. Our
          mission is to distribute toys and school uniforms to select local
          children’s charities, benefiting underprivileged children throughout the
           community.
          </p>
