          <p style="text-align: center;">Children’s Charities of Fort Worth was formed in 1989 as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The charity is supported through directors and volunteers of the Fort Worth Margarita Society. Our mission is to distribute toys and school uniforms to select local children’s charities, benefiting underprivileged children throughout the community.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">The Margarita Ball is an annual charity event hosted by The Fort Worth Margarita Society. Entering into its 28th year, the event benefits several charity organizations in the Fort Worth area collectively called "Children's Charities of Fort Worth".
