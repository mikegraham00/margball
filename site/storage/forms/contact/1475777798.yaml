  I'd love to get more information on being a donor at this years margarita ball. I am a stylist with Trunk Club and we would like to show our support by donating a $200 gift card. 
  
  At Trunk Club we do things a bit differently that other clothing retailers - our sole mission is to take the hassle out of shopping. We pair you with a dedicated stylist who can help you build out a wardobe that you love - based on your style, budget and needs. Shop with us through our hand selected trunks sent to your home or in-person at​ ​our Clubhouse in Deep Ellum.​ ​
  
  Please let me know what the next steps are and if you have anymore donor availability. 
   
  Excited to hear back, 
  Taylor
