  Greetings,
  
  I have created a web page that features your organization in the Blue Pages of the Fort Worth Portrait Project:
  
  http://fortworthportraitproject.com/bluepages/nonprofit-organizations/
  
  Click on your organization’s name to see the page featuring links to your website and Facebook page. I’ve also included a form for people to share about their experiences with you.
  
  Also, may I share your organization's description about itself and its products/services? Most likely, this will be under an “about us” section on your web page. Sharing this information allows you to make the first impression on visitors to the page.
  
  If you are interested in having the first word on your page, then please let me know via this form or in reply to this email.
  
  Thank you,
  
  Raul
